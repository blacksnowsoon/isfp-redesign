## An Overview

- I have seen that the website of the company has the same look for a while long. So I thought to give it a new LOOK and here is what i comeup with so far, I wish if i had has more contents details but any way the research still going...

- So far i have been collecting all the static data in a single JSON file and constracted the pages with that data. That mean if the data in that file modifided will modify the pages. An approach of DMS (Data Management System).

- For all other content that has and action such as contact us, ask for demo or the staff corner. I have delevred the php version from the old website.

(Note): in the data json file if the key has a value as an object will add a link with a nested menu to the nav bar else will just add a link in the menu

## My process

[1] Collecting all the content data in one file to have an control over it.

[2] Drawing the path of the routes.

[3] Buliding each component with its owne style and positioning. it could be not best practice but also has it's pros, Each component would be independed and easy to maintained.

## Continued development

 Going through such challenges I think it's one of the best way to keep up to date with new techniques and increasing the level as developer.
